          {{name}} was a man who hated working.{{message}}
           He decided to rob a bank and escape to a tropical island.
           He planned everything carefully and waited for the right moment.
           He entered the bank with a mask and a gun and demanded all the money.
           He stuffed the cash in his bag and ran out of the door.
           He jumped into his car and drove away as fast as he could.
           He was so happy that he started singing along to the radio.
           He did not notice the police sirens behind him.
           He also did not notice the sign that said “Road Closed”.
           He crashed into a pile of bricks and was arrested.
